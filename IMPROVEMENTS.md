## How to Access

1. Start both servers with one command:
   ```
   ./start_servers.sh
   ```

2. Access the components:
   - Frontend visualizer: http://localhost:8080
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8080/api-docs.html
   - API connection test: http://localhost:8080/api_test.html
   - API Swagger docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Testing Features

To test the visualization:
1. Enter an expression like `3+4*5` or `(3+4)*5`
2. Click "Parse" or press Enter
3. Hover over nodes in the tree to see details
4. Try complex expressions with nested parentheses

To test error handling:
1. Enter invalid expressions like `3++4` or `(3+4`
2. Observe the detailed error messages and suggestions
